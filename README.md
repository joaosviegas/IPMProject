<h1 align="center">IPM Projects ‚Äì Human-Computer Interaction</h1>

## Project Overview

This repository contains two projects developed for the IPM (Intera√ß√£o Pessoa-M√°quina) course @IST - Instituto Superior T√©cnico (2024/2025), focused on UI/UX design and interaction optimization.

### üìÅ Project 1 ‚Äì Mobile App Redesign (Figma)
- **Goal**: Redesign the mobile interface for the Quizzes-Tutor app, improving usability and following design best practices.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Low-fidelity prototype (paper)
  - High-fidelity interactive prototype (Figma)
- **Features Redesigned**:
  - Create a quiz
  - Collaborative quiz creation
  - AI-generated quizzes

### üìÅ Project 2 ‚Äì Fast Target Selection (p5.js)
- **Goal**: Improve user performance in selecting the correct target in a dense grid (80 targets) within 2.5 seconds.
- **Technologies**: JavaScript with the p5.js library
- **Constraints**:
  - No alteration of scoring or Firebase code
  - No predictive help based on the correct label
  - No use of non-standard input/output devices

The final version is a browser-based sketch that tracks and submits selection time and accuracy metrics.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Figma**: For UI design and interactive prototyping
- **p5.js**: For visual and interactive programming in JavaScript
- **Firebase**: To collect and store test results
- **User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S)**: To assess users feedback

## Notes

- All solutions were tested and evaluated through user testing during lab sessions.
- Projects were developed following iterative design principles: ideation ‚Üí prototyping ‚Üí evaluation.
